- Crowdfunder bullets hit the shield during Protect and Serve 
- Cancelling shield with sprint does not work properly in multiplayer
- Skins bunch up in the menu. get that ScrollableUI mod 
- Pending an R2API update , some achievements can't be unlocked in multiplayer. (they only work for host or single player).
