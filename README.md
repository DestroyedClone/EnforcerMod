## Known Issues
- Teleporter particles kinda big (We could fix this but we won't)
- Crowdfunder bullets hit the shield during Protect and Serve 
- Cancelling shield with sprint does not work properly in multiplayer
- Pending an R2API update , some achievements can't be unlocked in multiplayer. (they only work for host or single player).

## Future Plans
- Skills++ and Scepter support
- More polish and skills maybe (absolutely no promises)

## Changelog
`1.0.3`
- Nerfed Super Shotgun fire rate; it was actually bugged and was never supposed to have the same fire rate as Riot Shotgun
- Fixed bug with Super Shotgun ejecting a stupid amount of shells, added unique shells
- Added a Needler gun for Visions of Heresy
- Calm idle stance now only triggers when out of combat
- Fixed bug causing shield to stop blocking damage if sirens were toggled during Protect and Serve
- Fixed the annoying (but harmless) warning messages on startup
- Renamed 'Blinded' debuff to 'Impaired'
- Added the host only warning to the Rules of Nature achievement since that one seems to be bugged too
- Some minor texture tweaks
- Fixed a rare bug involving a pink cube and Enforcer flying into space? Never actually found the cause but that cube is deleted so it should be gone

`1.0.2`
- Added keybinds to config
- Added a custom Crowdfunder Drone display, to try and fix the Crowdfunder bug(it didn't)
- Reworked Super Shotgun
- Added config for base stats and Riot Shotgun, more might come eventually but this is really tedious to code
- Enforcing Perfection achievement now scales better with the amount of Bustling Fungus you have

`1.0.1`
- Added dependencies oops

`1.0.0`
- Initial release

if you read all this you're cool
